# TODO

  * [ ] Email detlef asking about certain language decisions.
      - [ ] should non-deterministic choice choose one that can succeed over ones that will fail?
            {a, b}! could loop 0 times because b can't be applied, whereas a /can/ be applied.
      - [ ] can more than one node in a rule's match-graph have the same variable?
      - [ ] What are any potentially significant repurcussions of changing a label's type from a list to a single value?
  * [X] Solve node matching
  * [X] Enfore no 'Â¬mark's in a normal graph's label's markset.
  * [X] Have some error handling at all and report problems to the user.
      - [X] duplicate node IDs.
      - [X] same variable name in the parameter list.
      - [X] invalid variable name (given declared vars in rule)
  * [X] Remove alllll the unnecessary duplication of parameter types everywhere (in the variable type, in the label type, in the graph, in the rule parameters...)


# Questions
  * [ ] Should a variable be allowed to be reused in a rule's match graph?
        I think so, but they should all be the same value (and if not, then not a match)?
        If not, then enforce this.
